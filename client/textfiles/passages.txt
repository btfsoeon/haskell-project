This is our only chance. We have to take it. We need Kong. The world needs him to stop what's coming.

In the realm of Haskell build tools, I attempted to compile my project with stack. Little did I know, the build plan had plans of its own, and every update felt like a journey into the unknown. 'Let's break everything!' cried the build tool, as I embraced the chaos of version conflicts and compiler surprises.
^_^
As I entered the Haskell cabal, hoping for a smooth package installation, I found myself entangled in a web of version constraints. 'You want a package? Name your constraints!' chuckled the cabal file, as I struggled to balance compatibility while avoiding the pitfalls of version hell.
^_^
Exploring the magical land of Haskell extensions, I tried to wield the powers of Template Haskell. Yet, as I invoked quasi-quotes and splices, the compiler responded with cryptic error messages. 'Are you not entertained?' it seemed to ask, as I delved into the arcane arts of metaprogramming without a guide.
^_^
In the land of Haskell documentation, I embarked on a quest to understand a complex library. Alas, the Haddock scrolls provided sparse insights, leaving me to decipher the mysteries of type signatures and cryptic function names. 'Just read the types,' they said, as I pondered the enigma of undocumented abstractions.
^_^
Configuring cabal files is like walking on a version constraint tightrope. One misstep and it all falls apart.

Trying to find parking at UCSD is like searching for a mythical creature. Rumor has it that an open space exists, but no one has seen it.

My mom always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.
^_^
Navigating the Haskell package ecosystem felt like embarking on a treasure hunt without a map. As I sought a simple library, I stumbled upon a dependency maze, where each version brought forth a cascade of breaking changes. Oh, the joy of chasing elusive dependencies in the Haskell wilderness!

The 5 stages of finals week grief: Denial, Procrastination, Cramming, Caffeination, and finally, Celebrating that it's over.
